## GoTo Modifier for my Dobsaonian Telescope


The goal of this project is to make a GoTo system for my dobsonian telecope that I got back in the start of 2023. It should be computer controlled and be able to move to a selected target and also automatically track it. To make the GoTo I will primaraly be using an arduino fitted with a cnc shield that controls two NEMA 17 stepper motors witht the help of a rotary encoder. To aid my creation I will be using my schoools lazer vutter and 3d printers.
